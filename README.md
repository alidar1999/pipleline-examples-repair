# synthetic-data-pipeline
This repository hosts a data repair pipeline for Raspberry Pi C code single file applications. It allows us to use Gemini API to repair the code, and validate the repaired examples and store locally. Inside a linux environment, it can also allow you to check the syntax and build of the code using gcc toolchain.
